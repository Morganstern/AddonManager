# Addon Manager

Download, update and manage your addons. Now with 100% less Curse client!

Currently in development, it works but is very basic for now. There is no installer yet, so it needs to be built by Visual Studio for now. Requires .NET 4.6 or higher.

## Install Instructions (for now)
* Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/3vbo/addonmanager.git`
* Open `AddonManager.sln` in Visual Studio 2017
* Build the project
* Run the app through Visual Studio in Debug mode
